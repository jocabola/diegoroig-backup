title: Les variacions Goku
-
description:
<p>This painting belongs to a collective project inspidred by the Goldberg Variations (1742, Johann Sebastian Bach) where nine different artists painted the same subject under the same size and surface conditions: 200 x 200 cm. board.</p>

<p>I was working in my studio in Berlin while Arnau Bielsa, Daniel Fortià, Xevi Masmitjà, Benoit Peleran, Kenneth Russo, Roger Serrat-Calvó and Jaume Vilanova worked together in the same studio. All happened during the summer in 2010, just before the first exhibition which took place on the 4th of December at Sala 15 in the Museum of Arts in Olot.</p>
